    "## Conceptual Overview: What is ASR?\n",
    "\n",
    "ASR, or **Automatic Speech Recognition**, refers to the problem of getting a program to automatically transcribe spoken language (speech-to-text). Our goal is usually to have a model that minimizes the **Word Error Rate (WER)** metric when transcribing speech input. In other words, given some audio file (e.g. a WAV file) containing speech, how do we transform this into the corresponding text with as few errors as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional speech recognition takes a generative approach, modeling the full pipeline of how speech sounds are produced in order to evaluate a speech sample. We would start from a **language model** that encapsulates the most likely orderings of words that are generated (e.g. an n-gram model), to a **pronunciation model** for each word in that ordering (e.g. a pronunciation table), to an **acoustic model** that translates those pronunciations to audio waveforms (e.g. a Gaussian Mixture Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if we receive some spoken input, our goal would be to find the most likely sequence of text that would result in the given audio according to our generative pipeline of models. Overall, with traditional speech recognition, we try to model `Pr(audio|transcript)*Pr(transcript)`, and take the argmax of this over possible transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, neural nets advanced to the point where each component of the traditional speech recognition model could be replaced by a neural model that had better performance and that had a greater potential for generalization. For example, we could replace an n-gram model with a neural language model, and replace a pronunciation table with a neural pronunciation model, and so on. However, each of these neural models need to be trained individually on different tasks, and errors in any model in the pipeline could throw off the whole prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can see the appeal of **end-to-end ASR architectures**: discriminative models that simply take an audio input and give a textual output, and in which all components of the architecture are trained together towards the same goal. The model's encoder would be akin to an acoustic model for extracting speech features, which can then be directly piped to a decoder which outputs text. If desired, we could integrate a language model that would improve our predictions, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the entire end-to-end ASR model can be trained at once--a much easier pipeline to handle! "

    "### End-To-End ASR\n",
    "\n",
    "With an end-to-end model, we want to directly learn `Pr(transcript|audio)` in order to predict the transcripts from the original audio. Since we are dealing with sequential information--audio data over time that corresponds to a sequence of letters--RNNs are the obvious choice. But now we have a pressing problem to deal with: since our input sequence (number of audio timesteps) is not the same length as our desired output (transcript length), how do we match each time step from the audio data to the correct output characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier speech recognition approaches relied on **temporally-aligned data**, in which each segment of time in an audio file was matched up to a corresponding speech sound such as a phoneme or word. However, if we would like to have the flexibility to predict letter-by-letter to prevent OOV (out of vocabulary) issues, then each time step in the data would have to be labeled with the letter sound that the speaker is making at that point in the audio file. With that information, it seems like we should simply be able to try to predict the correct letter for each time step and then collapse the repeated letters (e.g. the prediction output `LLLAAAAPPTOOOPPPP` would become `LAPTOP`). It turns out that this idea has some problems: not only does alignment make the dataset incredibly labor-intensive to label, but also, what do we do with words like \"book\" that contain consecutive repeated letters? Simply squashing repeated letters together would not work in that case!\n",

    "Modern end-to-end approaches get around this using methods that don't require manual alignment at all, so that the input-output pairs are really just the raw audio and the transcript--no extra data or labeling required. Let's briefly go over two popular approaches that allow us to do this, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and sequence-to-sequence models with attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal speech recognition prediction output, we would expect to have characters such as the letters from A through Z, numbers 0 through 9, spaces (\"\\_\"), and so on. CTC introduces a new intermediate output token called the **blank token** (\"-\") that is useful for getting around the alignment issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CTC, we still predict one token per time segment of speech, but we use the blank token to figure out where we can and can't collapse the predictions. The appearance of a blank token helps separate repeating letters that should not be collapsed. For instance, with an audio snippet segmented into `T=11` time steps, we could get predictions that look like `BOO-OOO--KK`, which would then collapse to `\"BO-O-K\"`, and then we would remove the blank tokens to get our final output, `BOOK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can predict one output token per time step, then collapse and clean to get sensible output without any fear of ambiguity from repeating letters! A simple way of getting predictions like this would be to apply a bidirectional RNN to the audio input, apply softmax over each time step's output, and then take the token with the highest probability. The method of always taking the best token at each time step is called **greedy decoding, or max decoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate our loss for backprop, we would like to know the log probability of the model producing the correct transcript, `log(Pr(transcript|audio))`. We can get the log probability of a single intermediate output sequence (e.g. `BOO-OOO--KK`) by summing over the log probabilities we get from each token's softmax value, but note that the resulting sum is different from the log probability of the transcript itself (`BOOK`). This is because there are multiple possible output sequences of the same length that can be collapsed to get the same transcript (e.g. `BBO--OO-KKK` also results in `BOOK`), and so we need to **marginalize over every valid sequence of length `T` that collapses to the transcript**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to get our transcript's log probability given our audio input, we must sum the log probabilities of every sequence of length `T` that collapses to the transcript (e.g. `log(Pr(output: \"BOOK\"|audio)) = log(Pr(BOO-OOO--KK|audio)) + log(Pr(BBO--OO-KKK|audio)) + ...`). In practice, we can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate this, accumulating our log probabilities over different \"paths\" through the softmax outputs at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like a more in-depth explanation of how CTC works, or how we can improve our results by using a modified beam search algorithm, feel free to check out the Further Reading section at the end of this notebook for more resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with CTC is that predictions at different time steps are conditionally independent, which is an issue because the words in a continuous utterance tend to be related to each other in some sensible way. With this conditional independence assumption, we can't learn a language model that can represent such dependencies, though we can add a language model on top of the CTC output to mitigate this to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular alternative is to use a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. A typical seq2seq model for ASR consists of some sort of **bidirectional RNN encoder** that consumes the audio sequence timestep-by-timestep, and where the outputs are then passed to an **attention-based decoder**. Each prediction from the decoder is based on attending to some parts of the entire encoded input, as well as the previously outputted tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of the decoder can be anything from word pieces to phonemes to letters, and since predictions are not directly tied to time steps of the input, we can just continue producing tokens one-by-one until an end token is given (or we reach a specified max output length). This way, we do not need to deal with audio alignment, and our predicted transcript is just the sequence of outputs given by our decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an idea of what some popular end-to-end ASR models look like, let's take a look at the audio data we'll be working with for our example."

Fine-tuning is one of the techniques to perform transfer learning.
